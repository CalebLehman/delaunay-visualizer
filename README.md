# Delaunay Visualizer

A simple web application to showcase a Delaunay triangulation algorithm
that I wrote. The [triangulation
algorithm](https://github.com/CalebLehman/DelaunayTriangulation) is
written in C. The server running the visualizer is written in Go and
Javascript.

# Building

Get the source with
```
git clone https://github.com/CalebLehman/delaunay-visualizer.git --recursive
```
Then run `make` to build the server.

# Running

Start the server with
```
./server
```
